# Stack 

## What is a stack and what is it used for?
A stack can have many uses in the programming world but also a day to day life world. In this example we are going to apply a stack to the programming world by letting you work though some code and learn to apply and ultalize a stack. An example of using a stack in a day to day life is making panckaes. When you make pancakes you put the first one on the bottom of the plate and as you progress in making more pancakes you keep "stacking" or adding the new pancakes to the top of the first one. A stack keeps track of the data in the same way. The oldest place you visit or the oldest link you clicked in your search history are examples of stacks. Lets say you opened your laptop and wanted to shop on amazon. You type in google, Amazon, Shoes. If this is the order you search it in your search history in a stack would be Shoes, Amazon, google. This is useful in many cases. For example, If you clicked on some wrong shoes and you want to go back to the page you were just on you dont want to go back to google. You want to go back to the page that had the whole list of shoes before you clicked on one. This is another example of a stack being used in a programming and computer world. Stacks have many uses so why dont we jump right into more infomation about stacks.
